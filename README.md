# Welcome to my repo. I don't really know what to here, so I'm just going to type for a while :smile:

Let's go through my day today. I woke up at the unholy time of 8:15 AM and brushed my teeth. That was fun. Then I got my monch on with some breki (Honey Nut Cheerios of course). I then went to class (oh boy) and took some pristene notes. That happened for a while. Then I went home and did some homework (like right now). That's pretty much it.
